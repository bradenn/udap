# USBDMX

### Fork

Idk what the last guy was smoking, but there may be diamonds in the rough.

USBDMX, a versatile USB DMX library written in Go for programatic show control and special effects.

## Supported Controllers

* DIY FT232
  controller *[Steven Breuls Tutorial](https://stevenbreuls.com/2013/05/diy-usb-dmx-dongle-interface-for-under-10/)*

Planned for support:

* Enttec DMX USB Pro Mk2

If you don't see your controller here, but would like it to be added, create an issue with the name of the device and a
link to any more information.

## Quick Start

This will create a mock controller, set channels 1,2 and 3 to 255 and render the output to stdout once. If you have a
real world controller that is supported you can create a controller in the same way.

``` Go
config := usbdmx.NewConfig(vid, pid, outputInterfaceID, debugLevel)
config.GetUSBContext()

controller := mock.NewDMXController(config)
if err := controller.Connect(); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// set a fixture to bright white
controller.SetChannel(1, 255)
controller.SetChannel(2, 255)
controller.SetChannel(3, 255)

if err := controller.Render(); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

## Contribute

Documentation is a big part of any project, but writing it is very time consuming. Any documentation is greatly
appreciated, please adhere to the Go standards for writing documentation. Translations of existing documentation to
other languages will also be required.

Contributing code should have tests associated with it and all tests should pass. Code will not be merged into the
master branch until it has been proven to work and has passing tests.
