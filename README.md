# udap

##### Universal Device Aggregation Platform

Modules can be configured to control computer settings, lights, music, media, or even spaceships.

### Goal

##### Provide a clean, robust, and reliable, centralization for controlling complex or simple items.

## Components

```

endpoints.endpoint-a1.

```

### Modules

Modules are general purpose plugins that can be used to control or interact with other devices or interfaces.

### Daemons

Daemons are unlike modules, a daemon cannot be directly triggered, it is only called when there is a state change from
the UDAP core or from a module.

## Protocols

### Endpoint Authentication

An access key can be generated by creating a new endpoint.

```http request
POST /register/{accessKey}
```

### Endpoint WebSockets Protocol

```json
{
  "target": "endpoint",
  "operation": "enroll",
  "body": {
    "id": "endpointId"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "target": "endpoint|instance|entity",
  "operation": "create|delete|etc.",
  "body": {
    "instance": "instanceid"
  }
}
```
