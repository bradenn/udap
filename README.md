# udap
Universal Device Aggregation Platform

Connecting a bunch of shit to one centralized control panel is not "smart."
This is by no means a "smarthome" platform. Your home will not gain any intelligence, as it is a house, and cannot gain intelligence.

### Workflow
##### Web Browser -> Server -> Modules -> Items to control
Similar to openHab, Apple Home, Home Assistant, and all the other smart home bs. Difference is, this is meant for anything. Not just a house. Modules can be configured to control computer settings, lights, music, media, or even space ships.

### Goal
##### Provide a clean, rubust, and reliable, centralization for controling complex or simple items.
Udap is not intended to be the face of any control panel. Just a strong back-end.
